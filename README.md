## Stack

We want this App available on both iOS and Android, So we will be developing it with React on top of ionic 3 frame work. We prefer Ionic for this job because of it's rich UI components. 

## Coding Style
This will probably be my cleanest codebase. I'll be starting slowly, and I'll go through every react and redux best practices as the project progresses.

## CI/CD
I'll be using Ionic AppFlow for Continous Integration and Deployment

## Flow

I'll be using GitFLow for this project(Master, Development, Feature branches)
